# ODBC for Python and R

In this folder, I include the scripts to connect both Python and R with Microsoft SQL Server using the Open Database Connectivity (odbc) interface. 

## Packages
In Python, I utilize the *pyodbc* package for the connection.
```
import pyodbc
```

On the other hand, in R I use simply the *odbc* package:
```
library(odbc)
```
